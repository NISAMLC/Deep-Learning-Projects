## Dog breed classification is a type of image recognition task in machine learning.
 The goal is to develop a model that can analyze an image of a dog and identify its breed. This involves training the model on a large dataset of labeled images, featuring various dog breeds from different angles and in different conditions. By recognizing patterns in the images, the model learns to distinguish between breeds based on characteristics like fur type, facial features, and body shape. This technology has applications in pet identification, animal shelters, and even veterinary care.
