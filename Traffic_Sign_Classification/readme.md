# Traffic Sign Classification with Deep Learning

## A traffic sign classification project involves developing a machine learning model, typically using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to automatically recognize and categorize traffic signs from images. The process begins with collecting and preprocessing a dataset of traffic sign images, which includes resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images to improve model robustness. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. The CNN model is designed and trained on the training set, learning to identify distinctive features of various traffic signs. After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and fine-tuning is performed to enhance accuracy. The final model can be deployed in applications like autonomous vehicles to improve road safety by ensuring accurate traffic sign recognition
